# Farewell...

I start this series of pages throughout the year for every week (with the exception of this week due to my lazyness from last week.)

My objective is to big an update for those that would wish to see my progress and what's on my mind.

### How we got to this conclusion

During our last meeting on a faithful friday we had decided that we needed to keep going and start heading our own way, this was not meant to be some sort of "ban" or some sort of judgement day.

The way I see it, is, people have their own stuff to do, and now I need to get up and do what I had learned for my sake.
With that, I had decided that I should make updates in a public repository on github.

I will be writing more specific and detailed stuff, but there is not much for me to say... Although I have some information that I took a look into and made my own "decoding of".

### Meditation

The way it works is through the 3 most popular types of meditation. Those being:

- Choiceless awareness
- Focused attention
- Effortless existence

I had made a system for these 3. I will eventually explain what these are for at least tomorrrow.

But essentially for now, it's:

| Meditation Type | Main function boost | Secondary function boost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Choiceless awareness | All extroverted functions (80%) | All introverted functions (5%) |
| Focused attention | Process Functions (Ni and Ti) (80%) | Input functions (Te and Ne) (10%) |
| Effortless existence | Feedback functions (Si and Fi) (80%) | Output functions (Fe and Se) (10%) |

As of now I will try to make a detail explained.

I am gonna try my best on my behalf and for other people as well. I hope all of you manages to achieve your goals as well.

Take care...
